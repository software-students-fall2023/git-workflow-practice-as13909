<p>I find this article very interesting because as a former political science major who spent some time interning in and around local government I know first hand that the government is generally slow to accept, and furthermore understand new technology. Seeing the White House openly accept the power, benefits, and dangers that generative AI algorithms pose is a quite refreshing change to the way new technology is usually dealt with. 

<p>Furthermore, it is nice to see that many of the top companies in the generative AI field are signing on to keep AI safe. I do hope that these pledges are meaningful rather than just meaningless talks though. 

[NYT: 8 More Companies Pledge to Make A.I. Safe, White House Says](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/12/technology/white-house-ai-tech-pledge.html)

<p>The fastest and worst way for the government to really get caught up to speed regarding AI algorithms is for a nationwide problem to occur. Hopefully, this will not be necessary and that the pledges made by the companies would be serious, though in all honesty, most of the companies listed I am afraid really only care about their bottom line.
